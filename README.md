# Simulating L-Systems

Lindenmayer is a L-System library using modern (ES6) JavaScript with focus on a concise syntax. The idea is to have a powerful but simple base functionality, that can handle most use-cases by simply allowing anonymous functions as productions, which makes it very flexible in comparison to classic L-Systems.

Given production rules generate graphics for them using either the Javascript or the Haskell modelling package.
